                <p>Whistler enables users to swiftly document and publicize events they witness. Using multimedia captured by the user (audio, photo or video), the app
                    generates a report which includes a whole range of data to help you authenticate the veracity of the evidence: location, elevation, luminosity,
                    surrounding WiFi networks and cell towers. This data is automatically embedded into the report by Whistler, making it very difficult for users (or
                    malicious third parties) to fake a report.</p>
                <p>All reports below are public but users have the option to share reports privately.</p>
